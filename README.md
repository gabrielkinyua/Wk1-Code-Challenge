## Challenges Overview

### 1. Student Grade Generator
**Description**: This program prompts the user to input student marks (between 0 and 100) and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

| Marks Range       | Grade |
|-------------------|-------|
| Above 79         | A     |
| 60 to 79         | B     |
| 50 to 59         | C     |
| 40 to 49         | D     |
| Below 40         | E     |

**File**: `grade.js`

**How to Use**:
1. Run the script.
2. Input the marks when prompted.
3. View the corresponding grade in the output.

### 2. Speed Detector
**Description**: This program calculates demerit points for a driver based on the speed of a car. It uses the following logic:
- If the speed is less than 70, it prints `Ok`.
- For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), the program gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total.
- If the driver accrues more than 12 demerit points, it prints `License suspended`.

**File**: `speed.js`

**How to Use**:
1. Run the script.
2. Input the car's speed when prompted.
3. View the status or demerit points in the output.
